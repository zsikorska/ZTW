        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support and energy to an organism.
            It can be raw, processed or formulated and is consumed orally by animals for growth, health or pleasure.
            Food is mainly composed of water, lipids, proteins and carbohydrates. Minerals (e.g. salts) and organic
            substances (e.g. vitamins) can also be found in food.
            Plants, algae and some microorganisms use photosynthesis to make their own food molecules. Water is found in
            many foods and has been defined as a food by itself.
            Water and fiber have low energy densities, or calories, while fat is the most energy dense component. Some
            inorganic (non-food) elements are also essential for plant and animal functioning.

                <h3>Breakfast</h3>
                <p>
                    Breakfast is often called "the most important meal of the day", and for good reason. As the name
                    suggests, breakfast breaks the overnight fasting period.
                    It replenishes your supply of glucose to boost your energy levels and alertness, while also
                    providing
                    other essential nutrients required for good health.
                </p>
                <p>Many studies have shown the health benefits of eating breakfast. It improves your energy levels and
                    ability to concentrate in the short term,
                    and can help with better weight management, reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease in the
                    long term
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite the benefits of breakfast for your health and wellbeing, many people often skip it, for a
                    variety of reasons. The good news is there are plenty of ways to make it easier to fit breakfast
                    into
                    your day
                </p>

                <h3>Dinner</h3>
                <p>Dinner plays a vital role in our daily life. The last meal of the day is essential for us to have a
                    healthy body. It also plays a vital role in our social and family life. A good dinner time can give
                    us a
                    healthy life and memorable moments with our own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dinner improves the way our body functioning. A healthy and wholesome dinner can promote better
                    metabolic functions promoting greater success in our weight loss efforts. Good dinner has the power
                    to
                    balance the endocrine system and blood sugar levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Waking up during the night is caused by the fall of our blood sugar level. Then the body has to
                    release
                    amounts of glucose that has been stored, which can often make it difficult to get back to sleep. To
                    ensure that this does not happen, it’s important to have dinner that combines protein and
                    carbohydrate.

                <h3>Dessert</h3>
                <p>
                    Eating dessert after dinner is a common practice in the U.S.—from ice cream to cake to cookies and
                    more.
                    Craving something sweet after a savory meal makes sense. Your satisfaction with a certain flavor
                    profile
                    diminishes relatively quickly, and changing flavors, temperature and texture can promote more
                    pleasure
                    and satisfaction from food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A wide variety of dessert options are available with a wide variety of nutritional profiles. Pauyo
                    says,
                    "Having fruit in your dessert can add antioxidants and fiber to help reduce the risk of diseases and
                    promote gut health. Choosing desserts with nuts and seeds helps add healthy fats and protein, which
                    can
                    be beneficial for brain health. Adding dark chocolate and a variety of spices is also
                    health-promoting
                    due to their anti-inflammatory properties."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Desserts like ice cream and baked goods are generally pretty high in saturated fat, a contributor to
                    nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This condition results from fat accumulating on the liver and is
                    often
                    asymptomatic. However, in some people, it can lead to health complications like cirrhosis. Excess
                    consumption of saturated fat may also put you at higher risk for cardiovascular disease.

        <h3>Tip</h3>
        <p>
            Nutrition experts tend to recommend eating 3 balanced meals (350 to 600 calories each) and 1 to 3 snacks per
            day (between 150 and 200 calories each). The calories for each meal and snack depend on a variety of factors
            including, height, weight, age, gender and activity level.
